## SPI analysis based on an each station in the Lubusz voivodeship
In the Lubusz voivodeship we can specify six measuring stations:
* Babimost,
* Drezdenko,
* Krzyż,
* Lubinicko-Świebodzin,
* Sanice,
* Żagań.

#### Babimost
Starting with the first one, based on descriptive statistics we can estimate that it is rather intermediate region  in case of precipitation with mean across all SPIs about 0.1 (SPI-1 gives a bit higher results, while other a bit lower). Minimal value for SPI-1 is -6.26, which is quite concerning as values below -2 are considered as "Extreme drought". Other SPIs have also pretty low minimal values (-4.06 for SPI-3 and -2.1 for SPI-12). As for maximal values they are not as big as minimal ones - all of them are around 1.5 ("Very wet").

Moving to SPIs over time analysis we can clearly see, that moderate precipitation conditions prevail in the Babimost region. Just in some years there are higher values of SPI-1 (a bit about 1). It is worth noting that in the recent years there are two worrying values below -6, so maybe it is just a measurement error or it is a sign that the local climate is changing to drier. As for SPI-3 the differences between time periods are higher. More frequently very wet conditions are being seen, but in most of time, the precipitations are in a moderate range. In SPI-3 plot we can see a point below -4, which is "Extreme drought" as well. Switching to SPI-12, the range of values is smaller - just between -2 and 2. Most of them are in the "Moderate conditions" range, while some in year 2011 indicates more wet conditions and some just after them - in the end of year 2012 and beggining of 2013, seems to be much more dry. There is also one "Extreme drought" point, but occuring earlier in time that in SPI-1 and SPI-3. It was at the end of 2016 then, when in case of SPI-12 it is at the end of 2015.

Comparing all SPIs altogether, we can see that SPI-1 has the most flat curve around 0 (apart from the end of year 2016). Others have some fluctuations between -2 and 2. Overall we can estimate Babimost region as the one with moderate precipitation conditions.

#### Drezdenko
For the station in Drezdenko we can draw similar conclusions as for the Babimost one. Minimal values are -7.09, -3.84 and -3.73 for SPI-1, SPI-3 and SPI-12 respectively. These values are quite concerning and implies that in this region very dry periods can occur. Mean values are also similar to the ones in Babimost, so we can estimate that this region has mostly intermediate precipitation conditions as well. Maximal values are higher in this case, that is 2.18, 3.29, 2.83 respectively.

While considering SPI-1 over time plot we can see more "Extreme drought" points than in the Babimost region, but still, most of values are in the moderate range. Here, there is also the pattern of occurence of very extremely dought periods in the recent years, which is quite critical. In the SPI-3 plot there are more "Very wet" points, but still there are some "Extreme drought" ones, but not as low as in SPI-1. From that we can conclude that extremely dry periods do not last very long, at least up to year 2022. In the SPI-12 plot we can spot very interesting change around year 2018, which was not noticeable in the other plots. During this period precipitation was much higher with many values around 2.5. Apart from them, as on the other plots, most of points are in the moderate range with a few dry points in the recent years.

In this case, comparing SPIs gives different results than in the Babimost region. SPI-1 has much higher magnitude with four valleys below -6 in years 2002, 2021  and 2022 (two of them). SPI-12 curve is the most flat and close to zero, which is quite foreseeable considering big summing window in this case. To sum up, the Drezdenko region has moderate precipitation conditions, but with bigger tendention to droughts than Babimost.

#### Krzyż
In Krzyż, which is located in the near of Babimost, the precipitation conditions seems to be a bit better. Minimal values of -3.68, -2.04 and -1.54 for SPI-1, SPI-3 and SPI-12 respectively are giving hope that this region does not have tendencies to has such a big drought like the previous ones. Average values are all close to 0, while maximal ones are 2.68, 3.24 and 2.54 respectively. All this may indicate that this region is typically moderate with regular magnitude of SPI values.

Turning into SPI-1 plot our suspicions seem to come true. Most of points are in the  "Moderate conditions" ranges, with just a few a little above 2 and a little below -2. Also we can see a tendency that after very wet period, there is immediately a very dry one, which was not present in the previous regions. In case of SPI-3, we can see a period with bigger precipitations between years 2016 and 2018, but unfortunately with tendency to become lower in the recent years. SPI-12 indicates this period ever more, with a peak in the beginning of 2018. Apart from this period, precipitation conditions tend to be moderate.

Comparison of SPIs shows us, that all of them are quite similar to each other, while, as always, SPI-12 has the least sharp course. Just while looking at SPI-3 curve we can see some valleys.

#### Lubinicko-Świebodzin
Lubinicko-Świebodzin is a station located in the near of Babimost. It has minimal values: -3.42, -1.92 and -1.38 and maximal ones: 2.95, 3.76 and 2.72 for SPI-1, SPI-3 and SPI-12 respectively. We can see certain change there, that is firstly modules of maximums are higher that modules of minimums, as for their means. The average values itselves are around 0, so we can say - typically for this voivodeship.

While looking at SPI-1 plot over time, we can see two extremely wet points in the middle of year 2017, and four extremely dry ones from the beginning of 2018 to the beginning of 2022. In this region, most of precipitation conditions can be considered as moderate as in the previous ones. Taking SPI-3 into consideration we cannot miss a peak in the middle of year 2018, even higher that in the SPI-1 plot. Therefore we can consider this period as very rainy. Also the middle of year 2016 (probably August/September) has also quite high peaks of SPI values close to 2. In this plot there are only two points where SPI is considered as "Severe drought". Looking at SPI-12 plot we can be sure, that period between the middle of 2017 and middle of 2018 was extremely rainy with its peak of around 2.8 at the beginning of 2018. Apart from this phenomenon, the rest of SPI-12 values are in the "Moderate conditions" range.

While comparing SPIs between each other, the lines are quite similar. Of course, the most sharp one is SPI-1 with the smallest summing window - the highest variability, when SPI-12 with the biggest window has the lowest.

#### Sanice
Sanice station is located in the very south of the Lubusz voivodeship, far from the previously described stations. It has even less diversed SPIs values than Lubinicko-Świebodzin, which is estimated based on its ranges and standard deviations (=1). The minimal values are: -2.67, -1.83 and -1.72, while the maximal are: 2.01, 2.67 and 1.9 for SPI-1, SPI-3 and SPI-12 respectively. Mean values are close to 0.

There is not as much data about this station as about previous ones - just around five years, so the number of points at the plot is also lower. Nevertheless, there is only one "Extremely wet" point around August 2020 and two "Extremely drought" points around May 2020 and December 2020. In this case, as in Krzyż station, after wet periods occured very dry ones. As we can see year 2020 was full of extremes. SPI-3 plot shows similar pattern as for rainy periods in 2020, adding to this August of 2021. As we know, August is often a very rainy month, so it is consistent with assumptions. SPI-12 plot indicates August of 2021 even more, almost disregarding year 2020. Of course, most of points are in the "Moderate conditions" range.

Comparing SPIs in such a short period of time is not giving as interesting results as previously - all lines are similar to each other, but the biggest variability of SPI-1 and smallest of SPI-12 is still visible. As for the others stations, precipitation conditions are mostly between -1 and 1, that is - moderate.

#### Żagań
Żagań is located nearly a hundred kilometers north to Sanice, but its statistics are still similar. Minimal values are: -3.59, -2.61 and -2.48, while maximal: 3.5, 2.73 and 2.3 for SPI-1, SPI-3 and SPI-12 respectively. As we see deviations up and down are quite alike. Mean values are close to 0.

SPI-1 values across years are quite deviated. Most of them are in the "Moderate conditions" range, but not as much as in the previous cases. There is a big amount of points in the "Very wet" and "Extremely wet" ranges and a few in "Severe drought" and "Extremely drought". It is worth to mention, that these values are not very high/low - they are always close to the module of 2 to 3. In case of SPI-3 the model is similar, of course, with smaller magnitude due to the window. Plot of SPI-12 is very interesting, as at the beginning of available data (around 1992-1994) there was an extreme drought in this region, which also occured in 2018-2019 and 2023. There was also very rainy periods, one just after this severe drought in 1994, and others in 2002/2003, 2009, and between 2011 and 2014. Overall, this plot suggests a very large variation in rainfall in this region.

Comparing SPIs in this region shows the previously noticed pattern - the bigger the window, the flatter the curve. The precipitation conditions are mostly moderate, but with tendentions to fluctuate up and down.

## SPI analysis for the whole Lubusz voivodeship
Now, we are focusing on the whole Lubusz region. The descriptive statistics reminds the ones with previously analyzed particular stations, but they are a bit more balanced. The minimal values are: -1.62, -2.23 and -3.13, while the maximal ones: 2.33, 3.45 and 3.35 for SPI-1, SPI-3 and SPI-12 respectively. Mean values are around 0, but all are negative. Just from this statistics we can see, that Lubusz voivodeship has moderate precipitation condition with tendention to become more dry, but there are periods where it is very rainy.

While focusing on the map with mean SPIs across all years, the verdict is simple. No matter whether it is the north or south of the voivodeship, rainfall is always moderate. Unfortunately we cannot compare western with eastern part, as our stations are located just in the center or east of the Lubusz.

When we look at SPIs over time plot, we can say that, overall, Lubusz is becoming more rainy! This is quite a good information, as most of our country is struggling with droughts now, but looking at SPI-1 plot, we can clearly see that from year 2016 in Lubusz voivodeship the rainfall are pretty extreme (this is not the best information, but it is good that there is rain at all). It is also worth noting that around year 1992-1994 there was a severe droughts, while in other periods precipitation conditions were quite moderate. SPI-3 plot shows as pretty the same, with slightly more balanced scale. Additionally it indicates droughts in 1996, 1998 and 2003. As always, SPI-12 is the most balances one, due to the big window size.

Summing up, Lubusz voivodeship has moderate precipitation conditions, with tendention to big rainfalls in the recent years. While it is quite promising, we have to be aware, that such a big amount of rain could cause flash floods and crop losses.
